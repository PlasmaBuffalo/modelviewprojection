== Adding Depth
//TODO - discuss what the z component is, show graphs.
//TODO - show X, Y, and Z rotations graphically with gnuplot.
//TODO - make appendix for rotation around arbitrary axis

== Moving the Camera in 3D



// TODO -- draw_paddle_1 is still using only 2D, explain implicit 3D of z have 0 for a value
Draw square, relative to paddle 1.


TODO - discuss the framebuffer, and how it allows us to draw in
       a depth-independent manner.  we could force the programmer
       to sort objects by depth before drawing, but that's why mario64
       looked good and crash bandicoot had limited perspectives.
       also reference the section in the beginning which clears the
       depth buffer.


Set the default depth for all fragments
Set the depth test for all fragments.



TODO - write something about how "now that depth testing is enabled for all subequent demos, rerun the//vious demo to show that the square becomes hidden as the user navigates
