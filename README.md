3D Graphics Using High-School Math
==================================

Learn how to build 3D graphics using math you already know.
This codebase demonstrates how to create objects, put
them where you want them to go, view the scene with a camera
that can move, and how to project that 3D data to a 2D screen.


For further information, such as lighting, shadows, and
OpenGL in more explicit detail, consult
1) OpenGL redbook/bluebook. (OpenGL superbible v4, because it covers fixed function and shaders)
2) Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics
3) Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice in C (2nd Edition)

For RayTracing
1) Physically Based Rendering
2) Ray Tracing from the Ground Up


Approach
--------
This book uses "mistake-driven-development".  I show incrementally
how to build a more complex graphics application, making mistakes along
the way, and then fixing the mistakes.
