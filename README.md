3D Graphics Using High-School Math
==================================

Learn how to build 3D graphics using math you already know.


Approach
--------

Most graphics book are bad, objectively.  They require knowledge
of linear algebra, and none of them show explicitly how to make a
moving camera.

This book uses "mistake-driven-development".  I show incrementally
how to build a more complex graphics application, making mistakes along
the way, and then fixing the mistakes.
